# 100-Days
100 days of code challenge!

I'm going to be doing a guided progressive 100 days of code challenge here! I'll be uploading my dayly updates and new files, in the hopes at the end of it I'll develop a confident and comfortable relationship with Python coding, as well as a few relevant side languages and different frameworks. I'm most excited for Flask! :)
